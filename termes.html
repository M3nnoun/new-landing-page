          provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the
          foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You
          through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything
          through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
          the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
          indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
          information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
          privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or

        </p>
        <p>
          Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
          limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
          which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
          these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest
          extent permitted by law.
        </p>
      </div>
          <h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer </h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with
              all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum

              behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective
              licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties,

              the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability,
              fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and
              warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
              performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
              foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and
              makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
              requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work
              with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate
              without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards
              or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
              corrected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
              company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
              express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
              Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
              included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
              error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of
              any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv)
              that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or
              on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan
              horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
              warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
              consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
              not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
              set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
              enforceable under applicable law.

            Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
